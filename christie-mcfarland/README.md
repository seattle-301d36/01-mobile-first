## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We needed to match a website as best as we could. This includes responsive design that changes based on the device used. This responsive design was primarily done within CSS, and made use of media queries. 
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
A user must have knowledge of the @media and the :hover commands in CSS. 
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
